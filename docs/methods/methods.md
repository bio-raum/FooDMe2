# Standardized methods

FooDMe2 aims at offering **validated** pre-configured standard methods that can be chosen with a single parameter.
This is implemented with the `--primer_set` argument.

Currently following standard methods are implemented:

* 16S metabarcoding of mammals and birds (German ASU L 00.00-184)
* 16S metabarcoding of insects (Hillinger et al. 2023)
* 16S metabarcoding of fish (Dobrovolny et al. 2019; using ASU L 00.00-184 )
* COI metabarcoding of fish (Guenther et al.)
* COI metabarcoding of insects (Park et al. 2001)
* CYTB metabarcoding of fish (German ASU L 10.00-12)
