# FooDMe 2

This pipeline performs processing of mitochondrial amplicon data to profile the composition of eukaryotic taxa.

Typical applications are in the analysis of food products, animal feed or seed materials.

FooDMe2 is a complete re-write of [FooDMe](https://github.com/CVUA-RRW/FooDMe/tree/master) with improved capabilities and portability. If you are migrating from FooDMe and are curious about the changes, you
can read about them [here](docs/migration.md).
