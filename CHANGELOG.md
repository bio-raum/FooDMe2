## 1.0.0

First release.

Re-implements FooDMe1 functions in a Nextflow pipeline. We designed FooDMe 2 to be more flexible and take away some of the complexity encountered in FooDMe 1. This not only concerns the installation procedure, which is vastly streamlined now, but also the process of configuring and starting individual analysis runs. The new implementation also maes it easier to deploy, maintain, and to add additonal functionalities in the future.
Check the [migration doc](https://bio-raum.github.io/FooDMe2/dev/help/migration/) for more info.

## 1.0.0.alpha.x

Pre-release for public test. Currently implements only 16S Illumina sequencing of Birds and Mammals prepared according to the Dobrovolny method.

Check the documentation for installation and usage.

This release is for test purposes, things will probably break and the documentation is lacking in many parts.
Should you encounter any problem or have questions, please raise an issue directly on the repository or contact the developpers directly.
