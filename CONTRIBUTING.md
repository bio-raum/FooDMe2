# Contribution guide

Maintaining a repository is a lot of work and it is only possible with the
input for its users. That's why we love to get your feedback and continuously
improve! We want to contibuting to this project as easy and transparent as
possible. That's why we ask all contributions to go through a GitHub workflow.

## Ask a question, report a bug, or suggest new features

Wether you wish to report a bug, discuss the current state of the code,
how to use it, or propose new features, the GitHub repository is the place to
start.

Go to 'Issues' in the repository's menu and use the search bar to look for your
issue/question, maybe the discussion already exists! if you don't find what
you are looking for, use the green button
['New Issue'](https://github.com/bio-raum/FooDMe2/issues/new)
and describe your problem/question with as many details as possible.

### Bug reports

Solving Bugs is not always easy and usually requires to be able to precisely
understand what happened. Try to include the following in your report, so we
can solve the problems quickly:

- A quick summary and/or background
- The software versions
- A precise description of the problem (what did you do? What happened?)
- Join input data that reproduce the problem if possible
- Attach relevant log files to the issue

## Improving the documentation

Writting a documentation is a big task and we are gratefull for any help
to expand and improve it.

If you find a specific section of the documentaiton unclear, or would like to
see it in other languages, we would love to hear about it, or if you feel like
it, try suggesting modifications.

## New primer set or target configuration

We are always looking forward to expand the range of presets for new targets or primers.

### Improved configuration for existing targets/primers

If you are not satisfied with some of the presets and find some tweaks to work better, you can
submit changes through an issue or pull-request.
Please provide the specific configuration that is concerned and the improved parameters.

### New configuration

If you work with primers or targets that are not yet included in the preset, you can submit 
your configuration to be added to the preset. If you are struggling with finding good presets feel 
free to get in touch for some help.

We usually ask that new configuration be tested on available data (either published of available through repositories).
